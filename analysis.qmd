##Executive Summary

This project investigates Australiaâ€™s projected population growth, exploring both national and regional trends across the eight main regions of Australia. Using official projection datasets and demographic assumptions, we pinpoint the influence of fertility, mortality, and migration on future scenarios. Through linear modeling, we quantified and contrasted these factors to reveal how assumptions shape projections. Our results show that migration has the strongest impact on population growth, followed by fertility, with mortality having the least influence.
