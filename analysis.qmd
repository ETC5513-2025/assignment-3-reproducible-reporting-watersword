## Introduction

Australiaâ€™s population is expected to grow significantly over the coming decades. Understanding this growth is crucial for informing infrastructure, healthcare, education, and housing policies. In this project, we explore:

- How is Australia's total population projected to change over the years?  

- How is the total population projected to grow across different states and territories over time?

- How do different assumptions (fertility, mortality, migration) influence these projections? 

Our analysis leveraged two key datasets: one detailing state-level population projections and another outlining scenario-based demographic assumptions. A linear modeling framework was applied to quantify the influence of each demographic factor and evaluate projection accuracy across different regions. This approach integrated statistical analysis and visualization to deliver a comprehensive view of Australia's demographic future. The research aimed to pinpoint which factors contribute most significantly to projected population changes.
