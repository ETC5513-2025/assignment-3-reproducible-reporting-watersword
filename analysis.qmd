## Introduction

Australia’s population is expected to grow significantly over the coming decades. Understanding this growth is crucial for informing infrastructure, healthcare, education, and housing policies. In this project, we explore:

- How is Australia's total population projected to change over the years?  

- How is the total population projected to grow across different states and territories over time?

- How do different assumptions (fertility, mortality, migration) influence these projections? 

Our analysis leverages a single official dataset detailing regional population projections and scenario-based demographic assumptions. A linear modeling framework is applied to quantify the influence of each demographic factor and evaluate projection accuracy across regions. This approach integrates statistical analysis and visualisation to provide a comprehensive view of Australia’s demographic future. The research aims to identify which demographic variables drive the most substantial changes. By comparing alternative projection scenarios, we gain insight into the sensitivity of future growth to changes in policy or global conditions. Our findings emphasise the dominant role of migration, followed by fertility, while mortality has comparatively minimal effect.
